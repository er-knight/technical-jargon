Static Site Generation (SSG), also referred to as pre-rendering, is another popular technique for building fast websites. If the data needed to server-render a page is the same for every user, then instead of rendering the page every time a request comes in, we can render it only once, ahead of time, during the build process. Pre-rendered pages are generated and served as static HTML files.

SSG retains the same performance characteristics of SSR apps: it provides great time-to-content performance. At the same time, it is cheaper and easier to deploy than SSR apps because the output is static HTML and assets. The keyword here is static: SSG can only be applied to pages consuming static data, i.e. data that is known at build time and does not change between deploys. Every time the data changes, a new deployment is needed.

If you're only investigating SSR to improve the SEO of a handful of marketing pages (e.g. /, /about, /contact, etc.), then you probably want SSG instead of SSR. SSG is also great for content-based websites such as documentation sites or blogs.
